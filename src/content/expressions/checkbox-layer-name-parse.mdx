    description: "Splits the current layer's name by underscores and uses parts [2] and [3] to build the effect name. For a layer named <code>Team_Logo_Home_Primary</code>, this would look for an effect named <code>Home_Primary</code> on the <code>CHOOSE TEAM</code> layer."

## Usage Notes

### Naming Convention

Your layers must follow a consistent naming pattern with underscores:

```
Part0_Part1_Part2_Part3
```

The expression uses `Part2_Part3` to find the matching checkbox.

### Example

| Layer Name | Effect Name Searched |
|------------|---------------------|
| `Player_Card_Home_Goalkeeper` | `Home_Goalkeeper` |
| `Team_Logo_Away_Secondary` | `Away_Secondary` |

### Setup

1. Create a control layer named `CHOOSE TEAM`
2. Add Checkbox Controls with names matching your layer naming pattern
3. Name your layers consistently with underscores
